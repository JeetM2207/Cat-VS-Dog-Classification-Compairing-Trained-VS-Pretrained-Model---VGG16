# 🐱🐶 Cat VS Dog Classification
**Comparing a Custom Trained CNN Model vs Pretrained VGG16 Model**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end image classification pipeline to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. It compares the performance of a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch with a transfer learning approach using the pretrained **VGG16** model.

## 📌 Project Objective

- Train a CNN from scratch on the **Dogs vs Cats** dataset.
- Fine-tune a pretrained **VGG16** model on the same dataset.
- Compare training time, validation accuracy, and generalization performance of both approaches.
- Visualize training curves for clear comparison.
